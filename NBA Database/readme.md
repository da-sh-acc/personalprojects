## NBA Database Data Collection

This notebook accesses NBA Data through the [NBA API Python Package](https://pypi.org/project/nba-api/), cleans and converts the data into pandas dataframes and then stores the tables in a sqlite database. The tables will also be exported into a SQL File to be used in any SQL database. The SQL database created in this notebook will be used to create an automated dashboard in Tableau that tracks the history and current statistics of a selected team in the NBA. This project was influenced by previous work done with the [European Soccer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer) from Kaggle. This dataset was created to serve as a database to be used for public use, and to be used in personal analytical projects.
