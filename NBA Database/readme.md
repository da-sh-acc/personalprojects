## NBA Database Data Collection

This notebook accesses NBA Data through the [NBA API Python Package](https://pypi.org/project/nba-api/), cleans and converts the data into pandas dataframes and then stores the tables in a sqlite database. The tables will also be dumped into a SQL File so that it can be imported into any database system. The purpose of this project was to practice skills in API data collection and database management, and was influenced by previous work done with the [European Soccer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer). This dataset will serve as the basis for the main project of building a team-based dashboard that tracks game stats, schedule and player information during the NBA Season.
