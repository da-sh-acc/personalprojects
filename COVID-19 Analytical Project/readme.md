Over the course of the pandemic, I became interested in learning about how COVID-19 was affecting the US and especially how it affected different parts of the country. This project explores Covid data from 2021 and 2020 to highlight the overall trends and seasonality of case numbers using a multitude of visualizations. The media cycle constantly focused on large states like New York and California due to the number of overall cases, but I wanted to examine each state using scaled statistics to better understand how the pandemic affected each indvidual state. The data was collected from the [Johns Hopkins CSSE Covid-19 Data Repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).
