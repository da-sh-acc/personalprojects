Over the course of the pandemic, I became interested in learning about how COVID-19 was affecting the US and especially how it affected different parts of the country. This project explores Covid data 2021 and 2020 to highlight the overall trends and seasonality of case numbers using a multitude of visualizations. The media cycle constantly focused on large states like New York and California due to the number of overall cases, but I wanted to examine each state using scaled statistics to better understand how the pandemic affected each indvidual state.

Before the beginning of each season, teams in the National Basketball Association have to predict attendance for the year in order to properly order and staff the arena. The main purpose of this project was to collect a wide range of statistics including in-game, team, social media, weather and census data to use for an attendance prediction model. The data covers the 2019-20, 2021-22, and 2022-23 NBA seasons and was collected through accessing a set of APIs and utilizing data scraping. Multiple features were calculated from the in-game statistics to create a final dataset with 113 features. Forward selection was used to pick a final set of 20 features, and the features were then run through a decision tree regression model from scikit-learn.
